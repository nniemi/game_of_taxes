## Game Of Taxes

This program was part of my Datastructures and Algorithms course during the fall of 2021. **Only the datastructures.cc, datastructures.hh and readme.txt are my own implementation, rest of the program is from our course professors and teachers**

The course assignment was basically to create a database and implement different algorithms to perform different functions. The point was to make the program as efficient as possible. 


# Prg1
The first part of this program, introduces a database manipulator, where you can store 
data from towns and use functions to display this data. There are 
total of 20 different functions to store and display data. 

The idea of this part was to make the operations as fast as possible by implementing different sorting algorithms and decisions during coding the functions.

# Prg2
Second part of the program, still a bit improving to be done, introduces a road network to connect the towns which were implemented in Prg1. The idea was to use graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, A* and Kruskal. Currently only BFS is implemented.
